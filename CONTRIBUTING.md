## Pull Requests

2. If an entry does not meet conditions *(a)* to *(d)* there has to be an explanation either in the description or the pull request why it should be added to the list.

Self-promotion is viewed critically, but suggestions will be approved if the criteria match.

Furthermore, please ensure your pull request follows the following guidelines:

* Please search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Please make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
* Use the following format for libraries: \[Library\]\(URL\) - Description.
* Entries should be sorted in ascending alphabetical order, i.e. a to z.
* New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
* Keep descriptions short, simple and unbiased.
* End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

Thank you for your suggestions!
